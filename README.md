# Highspot Coding Exercise

## A few notes
Thank you for considering me for a developer role at Highspot! :blush:
If there are any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me at aharmo3@gmail.com. 

This application was built with Angular 6. My team is ramping up on this technology and this coding exercise presented the opportunity for me to 'geek out' and have some fun!

## Project Structure & TODO's
This application follows the scaffolding that Angular CLI provides (which can be a lot of files!). To go directly to the code that I authored:

`~/src/styles.scss`

`~/src/app`

A few items that I was not able to complete but would consider important for a release:
* SEO friendly implementation of the Infinite scroll. This would involve adding a hidden pagination at the bottom with meta data in the tags to let spiders know where to crawl. 
* Add pagination number to query string in order to enable deep linking of pagination results. 
* Add Jasmine Unit Tests

## Getting up and Going
* Clone Repo
* Run `aharmo3.github.io && npm install`
* Run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Known Issues
* When running the ng build -prod command, the angular cli throws a very vague error that I am researching. 
* Intermittenly I was seeing a error regarding the card interface.
